# Core-Community-Call

The Core Community Call is a monthly meeting across Solana core protocol developers to discuss current development, future features, and align on standards across multiple validator clients. These calls will be recorded and uploaded to the [Solana Foundation Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SolanaFndn).

This repository is to collect the meeting notes and help define future call agendas.

### Agenda Submission
To propose a topic, see the [topic-submissions/submission_template.md](topic-submissions/submission_template.md). Open a PR <u>with a new file</u> containing your submission from the template.

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature
- The topic involves the Solana protocol at a low-level. This means DApps development is not allowed.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Core Community Call is not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.
